# Day 006

## Rest pushes you forward.
***
- After resting in day 5, I woke up refreshed and without any brain fog, which was awesome.
- Before I started the day, I decided to create a list of objectives of the current day. It was a fairly simple list, but it worked for me.
### The Mighty, ok not so mighty, List
***
- [x] QuickSort
- [x] MergeSort
    - [x] When to use
- [x] Tree Insertion
- [x] Tree traversal
## ...Disappointing?
***
- It might be, but it got the job done, because, to implement that, I had to go over some concepts that I didn't knew I was lacking, such as recursion and proper swapping.
- Alongside with that, I was able to properly understand the divide and conquer of QuickSort and MergeSort, still, I don't think I've grasped it fairly well yet, so it's in the tomorrow list.
- What I did was to implement the sorting algorithms, create notes for them so I can properly understand and implement them further (might need to write it on paper to get a good grasp), and create some ok test cases to do it (Also huge thanks to [boot.dev](boot.dev), the articles really help me understood the process).
- After that, I went to implement the Tree, which ended up being a Binary Search Tree, BST for short. AND THOSE ARE FUN.
- Because of that, I was able to get a good grasp of recursion in this case, reminding me of creating stop points and clear return cases.
- There was no leetcode, but it was a good day. Tomorrow I'll crunch more leetcodes and see what I can get done.
