# A welcoming surprise
***
- Today something unexpected happened. I passed the screening portion for a interview, and now I'll be doing the tech interview.
- Since it wasn't exptecting for this, I changed the focus to solve leetcode, so there is now a folder to track the questions that I've done.
- For now, the folder won't have much organization, nor many problems.
- The organization of the folder will follow:
    ```txt
    Number_Name.go
    ```
- By doing that, it's easy to just grep the one you want.

# LeetCodes of the Day
- I've mainly solved a few ones that I previously did that are simple, like [001_TwoSum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) ~~I know it's the most basic one, but hey, I started here and have sentiments for it, so whenever i'm going into a LC streak, I like to do this one first.~~
- Alongside, I also did the [121_Best_Time_to_Buy_Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock), which helps me stay keen with Sliding Window and array itself.
- In the end, I did the [57_Insert_Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval), which is a new one for me. At first I didn't notice the **Ordered** screaming at my face, and went for a iterative approach, but then, when reading the editorial, I could grasp that binary search was way better.
- Liked this one, it's a cool exercise and falls more into a real world usage. You can check the code for it [here]("../Leetcode/57_Insert_Interval.go").

# Final Considerations
- The system i've set to study for leetcode, since I need to do them in a timely manner, is to set a 15 minute timer to try and solve the problem, and then go to the editorials.
- If the editorials do not help, then I go for the solutions tab.
- Finally, if nothing of that helps me understand, I'll try to find a video solution for it. The objective with doing it is not to solve it per se, but to understand what is happening in this kind of problem and be able to replicate it in similar problems.
