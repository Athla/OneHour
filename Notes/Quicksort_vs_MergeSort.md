# When to use
***
## Merge Sort
- If stability is required go for merge sort, it's safer and more stable, however, has a more consistent output (when O(n log n) is required)
- The extra mem usage is not a concern
***
## Quick Sort
- If it's an array and less mem usage is required (it's done inplace)
- When Average Case >> Worst Case
- Random, small datasets
